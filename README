The C++ version is one I implemented a long time ago, and may have bugs.
Look at the C version for the correct code, tested with numerous corner cases.

This is the implementation of AVL search tree in C++ and in C.
Insertions are performed just as the algorithm instructs,
along with a recursive function checking for any inconsistency in balance
factor.

Newer, C variant:
Input format: Number of elements, followed by the elements.
Output: Shows preorder traversal of tree.
(Inorder traversal is obviously the list of sorted elements)

Older, C++ variant:
Input format is simple. Just follow the on-screen instructions.
ONLY one thing you need to be warned of, is that I used a "cin>>tmp"
hack to make the screen pause wherever applicable. So, you need to insert
an integer to get rid of the interrupt.
Like, if you want to insert 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
I would first enter the number of elements, i. e., 5.
Then:
1
<some random integer>
2
<some random integer>
3
<some random integer>
4
<some random integer>
5
<some random integer>

-->After this stage, you will come across the MENU, where you can perform
insertion and Traversal operations on the AVL search tree.

BINARY FILE INCLUDED IN THIS PROJECT
I compiled this binary file on ARCH Linux  x86_64, i.e., 64-bit Linux platform.
Run the file as:

$ ./avl_search_tree

on a 64 bit Linux machine.
